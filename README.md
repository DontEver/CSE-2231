# CSE 2231: Software II - Software Development and Design

**Overview**  
Focuses on advanced data structures, sorting algorithms, language processing, and component interface design in Java. Emphasizes practical application of design-by-contract and best practices in software development.

## Core Competencies

- **Data Structures**: Hashing, search trees, linked data structures, layered data representation.
- **Software Engineering Principles**: Design-by-contract, interface contracts, representation invariants, abstraction functions.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting algorithms, algorithm analysis and runtime estimation, binary search trees.
- **Advanced Java**: Interfaces, classes, inheritance, assertions, core Java features aligned with the Java Collections Framework.
- **Components**: Stack, Queue, Set, Map, and `BinaryTree` components; `SortingMachine` and language processing with trees.
- **Software Testing & Debugging**: Specification-based testing, recursion, test plans, debugging techniques.
- **Version Control**: Exposure to version control systems (e.g., CVS, SVN).
- **Team Projects**: Collaborative software development with multiple milestones.

> **Tools Used**: Java, version control systems (CVS, SVN).
