You're right, but this is Quisante, a hero with 4700 HP, 329 armor, and 201 magic resistance. It has unstoppable abilities, shields, and can even cross walls. It controls, and even has a cooldown of only one second, requiring only 15 mana. Switching stances even refreshes the cooldown of W, and it deals true damage. Furthermore, when its armor and magic resistance are increased, it gains ability haste, reducing the cooldown of Q, shortening its casting time, and it also gains attack power. And the W just goes ahhhhh!!!
